# 2D Puzzle Springs Assembler

2D Puzzle Springs Assembler is a C++ project designed to solve 2D puzzles for both convex and concave polygons. The system operates as a physical simulation, considering each piece as a rigid body and connecting springs between them to create an assembly. 

## Description

This project provides an innovative way to solve 2D puzzles. By treating each puzzle piece as a rigid body and introducing springs at specified locations, it simulates a physical assembly process. The input to the system is two-fold:

1. `pieces.csv`: This file contains the coordinates of each puzzle piece. Each row represents a unique vertex of a piece.

2. `springs_anchors.csv`: This file describes the location of the springs, each row represents a spring between two pieces.

Example files can be found in the `data/example/group_39` folder.
